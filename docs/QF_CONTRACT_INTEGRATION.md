# QF Contract Integration

## Overview

The Quadratic Funding (QF) contract has been integrated into the main application with a modern React-based interface. The integration includes:

## ‚úÖ Completed Components

### 1. QF Contract Hook (`src/hooks/useQfContract.ts`)
- **Purpose**: React hook providing simplified interface to QF contract
- **Features**:
  - Load active funding rounds
  - Fetch detailed round data with projects and contributions
  - Handle contributions with proper error handling
  - Format amounts and calculate time remaining
  - Mock data structure matching contract output

### 2. Contribution Modal (`src/components/city/ContributionModal.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Modal for making contributions to projects
- **Features**:
  - Predefined contribution amounts (1, 5, 10, 25, 50, 100 POP)
  - Custom amount input
  - QF impact preview showing estimated matching funds
  - Success/error states with animations
  - Proper loading states and form validation

### 3. Updated ActiveRounds Component (`src/components/city/ActiveRounds.tsx`)
- **Purpose**: Main QF rounds page integrated with contract data
- **Features**:
  - Real-time round selection and data loading
  - Contract-based project display with QF metrics
  - Integration with contribution modal
  - Proper error handling and loading states

## üîß Contract Integration Architecture

```
useQfContract Hook
    ‚Üì
PolkadotContext (wallet connection)
    ‚Üì
Contract Service (TODO: implement actual calls)
    ‚Üì
QF Smart Contract on POP Network
```

## üìù Current Implementation Status

### Mock Data Structure
The current implementation uses mock data that matches the contract's expected output format:

```typescript
interface QfRoundData {
  round_info: QfRound
  projects: QfProject[]
  contributions: QfContribution[]
  current_alpha?: number
  total_matching_available?: string
}
```

### Contract Address
- **Current**: Placeholder address in hook
- **Network**: POP Network (wss://rpc1.paseo.popnetwork.xyz)
- **TODO**: Update with actual deployed contract address

## üöß Next Steps for Full Contract Integration

### 1. Deploy QF Contract
```bash
# Deploy your contract to POP Network
# Update CONTRACT_ADDRESS in useQfContract.ts
```

### 2. Implement Real Contract Calls
Replace mock data in `useQfContract.ts` with actual contract interactions:

```typescript
// Example using polkadot-api
import { contracts, pop } from '@polkadot-api/descriptors'
import { createInkSdk } from '@polkadot-api/sdk-ink'

const qfSdk = createInkSdk(typedApi, contracts.qf_funding)

// Real contract calls
const roundData = await qfSdk.query.get_round_data(roundId)
const contributionTx = await qfSdk.tx.contribute(roundId, projectId, { value: amount })
```

### 3. Add Contract Administration
- Admin interface for creating rounds
- Add projects to rounds
- Distribute matching funds
- Monitor round status

### 4. Error Handling & Validation
- Transaction confirmation handling
- Network error recovery
- Input validation for contract constraints
- Gas estimation and fees

### 5. Real-time Updates
- Subscribe to contract events
- Live QF calculations updates
- Real-time contribution tracking

| File | Purpose | Status |
|------|---------|---------|
| `src/hooks/useQfContract.ts` | Contract interface hook | ‚úÖ Complete (mock data) |
| `src/components/city/ContributionModal.tsx` | Contribution UI | ‚úÖ Complete |
| `src/components/city/ActiveRounds.tsx` | Main QF page | ‚úÖ Complete |
| `contracts/qf_funding.contract` | Contract metadata | ‚úÖ Complete |
| `.papi/contracts/qf_funding.json` | Generated types | ‚úÖ Complete |

## üéØ Integration Benefits

1. **Type Safety**: Full TypeScript support with generated contract types
2. **Modern UX**: React-based components with animations and proper states
3. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and user feedback
4. **Extensible**: Easy to add new features and contract methods
5. **Responsive**: Works on mobile and desktop

## üìã Testing Checklist

Before deploying to production:

- [ ] Deploy contract to POP Network
- [ ] Update contract address in hook
- [ ] Test wallet connection flow
- [ ] Test contribution transactions
- [ ] Test error scenarios (insufficient funds, network issues)
- [ ] Test on mobile devices
- [ ] Test QF calculations accuracy
- [ ] Load test with multiple concurrent users

## üêõ Known Issues

1. **Contract Service**: Removed due to type complexity - needs reimplementation
2. **Time Calculations**: Based on timestamps, may need timezone handling
3. **Amount Formatting**: Currently uses 18 decimals, verify with contract
4. **Network Detection**: Should detect and validate POP Network connection
